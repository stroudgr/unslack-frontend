# unslack-frontend
 The frontend for a group project called Unslack - a Google Chrome extension that will help users track their online activity and motivate users to improve their time management skills through social accountability and informative statistics. This was a school project for the course CSC301 at the University of Toronto.


The code was written by myself, [Steve](https://github.com/kozastev), [Alana](https://github.com/manitsalana) and [Kevin](https://github.com/Pineapplebun). The remaining group members worked on the backend (which is not included in this repo).
